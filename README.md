Abstract
In this paper, we focus on the interfacial properties, relative volume change, and PVT behavior
of CO 2 and CH 4 in (w/ho) emulsions, which is encountered in heavy oil reservoirs during
secondary recovery methods such as water or steam injection. We generated the water-in-heavy-
oil (w/ho) emulsion using steam at 150 o C for two types of oils (27,000 cP and 4,351 cP). Next,
the stability of our emulsion was tested using different criteria such as phase separation, viscosity
of the produced emulsion compared with that of the starting oil, and the size and number of
water droplets in the continuous medium. The influence of water content in the emulsion was
found to be critical and thus subsequent surface tension (SF) and relative volume measurements
as well as PVT analyses were conducted using emulsions of different water contents with a
vol.% range from 10-70.
